# ðŸš‰ Mumbai Local Journey Planner

A web-based application to plan efficient journeys across Mumbai's extensive local train network. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, this planner determines the shortest route with the minimum number of stations between a starting and destination station. The project now incorporates a modern user interface built with **React.js** for a seamless and interactive user experience.
